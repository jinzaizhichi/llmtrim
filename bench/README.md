# llmtrim benchmark

Two axes, measured live: **tokens saved** (real tokenizer, at compress time) and **quality retained** (the A/B delta between the model's answer on the *original* vs the *compressed* request). A preset is only honest if quality holds at its token saving — the frontier of (saved, retained) is the benchmark, not the saving alone.

- **Model:** `qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-instruct` via OpenRouter (async-openai byot — the exact compressed body is sent, injected fields intact). A cheap, strong, **non-reasoning** instruct model: its visible output is the whole billed output, so prompt-side output shaping (terse / Chain-of-Draft) translates to real cost. Reasoning models bill hidden chain-of-thought as output that no prompt-side lever can cut — the cost win shrinks there.
- **Scoring:** ground-truth where possible (numeric-exact for math, pass@1 that *runs the unit tests* for code), token-F1 for extractive QA, tool-call match for agents, an LLM judge only for open-ended shapes.
- **Cost:** priced from a pinned [models.dev](https://models.dev) snapshot (`bench/pricing.json`), cached input billed at the `cache_read` rate.
- **Cache used %:** share of compressed input served from the provider prompt cache (`usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`).


## Bottom line

Across **112 A/B cases** on this real-usage mix (generation, chat, reasoning, code, RAG, agent, summary, cache):

| | original | compressed | saved |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| input tokens | 71,031 | 49,062 | **31%** |
| output tokens | 25,843 | 6,628 | **74%** |
| **total tokens** | **96,874** | **55,690** | **43%** |
| **round-trip cost** | **$0.0365** | **$0.0126** | **66%** |
| **answer quality** | **78.9%** | **82.2%** | **+3.3pp** |

**~66% cost cut, quality up +3.3pp.** Output is where it pays off — output tokens drop 74% via output-control, and real workloads are output-heavy. The cost % rides on the model's output:input price ratio (≈12:1 here); the underlying token cuts are model-independent (−31% input, −74% output), projecting to −57% / −59% at GPT-4o / Claude Sonnet rates and −44% on the input-heavy gpt-oss-20b. (An earlier input-heavy/short-output mix saved only ~9% — the lever was real but had nothing to cut; representative corpora surface the true savings.)


## Frontier

| corpus | shape | n | input saved | output saved | cost saved | cache used | quality (orig→comp) | retention |
|---|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|:--:|--:|
| `gsm8k` | Reasoning (CoT) | 7 | -46% | 94% | 25% | 0% | 43%→71% | +29pp |
| `humaneval` | Code generation | 12 | -15% | 29% | 27% | 0% | 100%→100% | +0pp |
| `dolly` | Generation (instruction) | 12 | 35% | 87% | 77% | 0% | 75%→58% | -17pp |

## Key findings

**Where compression wins** (cost cut, quality not significantly down):
- `gsm8k`: **cost −25%**, quality 43%→71% (+29±45pp).
- `humaneval`: **cost −27%**, quality 100%→100% (+0±0pp).
- `dolly`: **cost −77%**, quality 75%→58% (-17±33pp).
- `chat`: **cost −64%**, quality 25%→33% (+8±31pp).

**Within noise at this n** (negative but CI crosses zero — *not* confirmed regressions): `dolly` (-17±33pp). Scale n to resolve.

**The headline:** the per-stage **token gate guarantees fewer tokens, not preserved quality** — only this A/B quality axis catches the difference. The two regressions we confirmed and fixed were measured on **gpt-oss-20b** (a stronger model with tighter intervals): `code`'s compact-code output **−21.6±14.5pp** at n=37 → dropped from the preset; and `aggressive`+n-gram on `adult` **−100pp** (deterministic) → `ngram` now skips JSON records (recovers to 100%). On a weaker/noisier model the same levers mostly land inside their CIs — measure per model, and reserve lossy stages for inputs whose exact surface form the task doesn't depend on.

## Reading the numbers honestly

- **No single compression %** — it is input-shape dependent. Long/structured inputs (RAG, record arrays, long docs) win on *input* tokens; short prompts (math, code stubs) can go *negative* on input because `output_control` injects a fixed instruction whose payoff is **output-side** (shorter answers), invisible in the input measure. Read **cost saved**, which captures both.
- **Cache used % is ~0 for one-shot diverse prompts** (nothing to cache-hit across distinct requests) and high only when a long prefix repeats — see `cache` (fixed system dossier + varying queries), the canonical agent/RAG-over-fixed-context shape.
- **Small n** — these runs use modest n for cost; CIs are reported in the JSON. Scale n for tighter intervals; several deltas here sit inside their CI (noise).
- **pass@1 actually executes** the model's code against the unit tests — the strongest signal here (no judge noise).


## Improvements driven by these results

The benchmark is actionable, not just descriptive — each row below is a code change the frontier forced:

- **`ngram` → prose-only guard.** `adult` 100%→0% (deterministic) traced to n-gram glossary abbreviation of JSON records → the model miscounts. Fix: `ngram` now skips any segment holding a JSON array of objects; abbreviates prose only. `adult` recovers to 100%.
- **`code` preset → dropped `output_compact_code`.** Confirmed real at n=37 (pass@1 −21.6pp, CI ±14.5, interval clear of zero). Minified-code *output* costs correctness on a small model; the −36% lever (arXiv:2508.13666) holds only via fine-tuning. Now opt-in.
- **`glaive` / `agent` preset → no change.** The −8pp at n=12 was **noise**: at n=39, retention is **+0.0pp** (CI ±5.2). Verifying before acting avoided a wrong fix.
- **New presets.** `reasoning` (Chain-of-Draft) — GSM8K +17pp, compression *improving* accuracy. `cache` (stable prefix + Stage A) — ~92% of input served from cache on fixed-prefix workloads.
- **Meta.** The per-stage **token gate guarantees fewer tokens, not preserved quality** — only this A/B quality axis catches `adult`/`humaneval`. Lossy stages are now bundled only where measured safe.
